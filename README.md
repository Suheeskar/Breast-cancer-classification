# Breast cancer classification

Using the Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic data set for predictive analysis 

**Approach**

1) Importing libraries

2) Reading the concerned dataset

3) Data Understanding

4) Data cleaning

5) Data visualization

6) PCA

7) Splitting the Data and feature scaling

8) Building a various classification models like ("glm","rf","svmRadial","xgbTree","xgbLinear")

9) Making Predictions Using the Models

10) Model Evaluation using Confusion matrix

**Conclusion**

Out of all metrics, Logistic regression model gives the highest accuracy value

| Models | Accuracy values |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| glm | 97.8 |
| NB | 91.55 |
| XGB | 94.37 |
| XGB linear | 95.07 |
| SVM | 94.37 |
